This is a small app designed to facilitate looking up code words in their relevant API's. The language links are also bookmarklets.
They can each be dragged into a browser bookmarks toolbar and used from any page on the web. To look up a code word first select it,
then use the bookmarklet link in the bookmarks toolbar. 

API Search buttons can also be used directly. Click any language button and enter your text into the popup input field. Click "OK" and your word(s)
will be searched in the API for the chosen language. Using the buttons this way also allows for copying selected text from anywhere, clicking 
a language button, and pasting in the copied text. Again, click "OK" to run the API search for your code input.

More languages/buttons/bookmarklets will be added. I'm currently expecting to add Java, Ruby, and Python in the near future.
